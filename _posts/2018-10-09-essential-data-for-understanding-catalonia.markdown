# 1. 52 percent

That's the estimated percentage of Catalans (defined here as adult residents of Catalonia with Spanish citizenship) who would vote "yes" in an independence referendum.

We calculate this number by aggregating data from the 3 most recent ["Barometer of Public Opinion" surveys](http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/inici), the robust and representative carried out in Catalonia on the topic. We weight responses for population similarity, and assume equal levels of referendum-day turnout between the two "blocs".

# 2. 1066

That, according to the Catalan Dept. of Health, is the number of people that sought medical attention for injuries inflected by police during the October 1, 2017 referendum. [991 sought care the day of the referendum](http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2017/10/20/18/39/8b5ac693-70e7-41a8-b877-5d0d50a7004f.pdf), but that number [rose to 1066](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171020/2-ninos-y-23-mayores-de-79-anos-entre-los-1066-heridos-el-1-o-6366893) in the weeks after. There has been some [controversy over these numbers](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/02/hechos/1506963876_226068.html) since (a) they were published by the Government of Catalonia and (b) seeking medical care does not necessarily equate to having an injure. In any case, the following is agreed upon by nearly all parties: the large majority of injuries were minor, but there were some very serious injuries (30 concussions, blindness induced by a rubber bullet shot, etc.).

It's impossible to know the exact number of injuries (just as some who sought medical attention may not have been injured, others who may actually have been injured may not have sought medical attention). Videos of police action against voters have been [rigorously catalogued](https://catmemoria.cat/).

# 3. 431

That, according to the Spanish Ministry of Interior, is the number of police officers who were injured during the October 1, 2017 referendum. The same Ministry originally reported the figure as 39, [but raised the figure the following day to 439](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171002/431755741107/interior-policias-guaridas-civiles-heridos-1-o.html).

The evening of the referendum, The Ministry of Interior tweeted a video showing violence against police officers:

# 4. 79%

That, [according to polling](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20180422/encuesta-cataluna-referendum-independencia-6774152), is the percentage of Catalans who believe that a referendum is the best solution to the current political crisis.

# 5. 70

That, [according to polling](http://ceo.gencat.cat/ca/inici), is the age over which a majority of Catalans oppose independence: all age groups under 70 are majority pro-independence.

# 6. 77%

That, [according to polling](https://www.publico.es/politica/catalunya-80-catalanes-rechazan-prision-preventiva-politicos-soberanistas.html) is the percentage of Catalans who oppose the pre-trial detention of Catalan political leaders. Even [45% of voters of the staunchly anti-independence Ciudadanos party are opposed](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180625/45381887877/sondeo-gad3-la-vanguardia-financiacion-solucion-conflicto-catalan.html?utm_source=newsletters&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=politica&utm_term=20180625&utm_content=listado-de-noticias-de-la-seccion-de-politica) to preventive prison for Catalan political leaders.

# 7. 9

That is the number of Catalan politicians who have imprisoned for having organized the 2017 referendum. They are being charged with violent rebellion and sedition; if convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison. They have been in prison for 200-300 days. None have been convicted of a crime.
