description: El Confidencial reports that Josep Borrell, Spain's Minister of Foreign Affairs, has forwarded a powerpoint presentation in which the Catalan independence movement is compared with Brexit and Marine Le Pen to Spain's diplomatic posts, so that the presentation's content can be used in making arguments.

[El Confidencial reports](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2018-10-07/el-dosier-anti-independencia-que-circula-por-la-ue-y-borrell-ya-ha-enviado-a-las-embajadas_1626530/) that Josep Borrell (Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs) has forwarded to diplomatic posts a powerpoint presentation critical of the Catalan independence movement. <a href="{{site.url}}/pdfs/buenoarmijo.pdf">The document</a>, a 27 page powerpoint, compares the independence movement with Marine Le Pen's Front National and Brexit, points out Spain's high rankings in democratic indices, suggests that police violence against Catalan voters on October 1 2017 was fake news, and paints the independence movement as a political force driven by the rural and the wealthy.

It has not been independently confirmed that the document is authentic, or that it was indeed shared by Borrell with the Spanish diplomatic corps. Since El Confidencial has a history of publishing [manipulative or false stories](https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/politica/institut-luther-king-desmentit-quim-torra_304911_102.html), we make no claims as to whether this document was actually authored by Antonio Bueno-Armijo, presented the powerpoint to the European External Action Service, or shared internally among the Spanish diplomatic corps. Nonetheless, since the document is receiving significant exposure in social media, it is worth exploring the presentation's structure and content, particularly insofar as they contain misleading information. In this article, we'll dive into 7 manipulations in the anti-independence dossier.

# Manipulation 1: Police violence against voters on October 1 was "fake news"


Several slides of the presentation show images of police violence overlapped by a scroll-with-wings icon to suggest that the images were false:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/0.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/1.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>


The implicit argument is that since _some_ of the images showing police violence on October 1, 2017 were false, one cannot trust that police violence occurred at all. This tactic is a familiar one. It seeks to minimize the perception of the level of police violence during the Catalan referendum by changing the topic of the conversation from real violence to fake images. It was employed last October by then Foreign Minister Alfono Dastis:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ca"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spanish Foreign Minister <a href="https://twitter.com/AlfonsoDastisQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AlfonsoDastisQ</a> says pictures of Spanish police beating Catalans is &#39;fake news&#39; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/marr?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#marr</a> <a href="https://t.co/tpJ5ZtVX9z">pic.twitter.com/tpJ5ZtVX9z</a></p>&mdash; The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarrShow/status/922019217234259970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">22 d’octubre de 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


The "fake news" angle has more recently employed by Spanish government spokesperson Isabel Celaá, who suggested that ["many of the images"](https://youtu.be/Uotxawat8pE) from the October 1 referendum were fake, and that the police acted in "proportionality" with the exception of very few cases. It's essentially a  [Trumpian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/14/the-death-of-truth-how-we-gave-up-on-facts-and-ended-up-with-trump) tactic: deflect attention from a scandal by questioning the evidence of the scandal.

It is true that some images showing police violence and victims in October 2017 were false, manipulated, or simply from other events. These images were widely shared in some cases, but also quickly discredited.

True occurrences of police violence have been [meticulously documented and fact-checked](https://catmemoria.cat/en/), and reported on by [international media](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/01/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-referendum-vote/index.html). Police body-camera footage has been released as well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ca"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Subtitled in English: Spanish police storming voting sites last Oct in an attempt to prevent Catalonia from voting on its independence.<br><br>Many of the leaders who arranged the vote are in jail.<br>The police beating people in these videos are not.<br><br>EU Mediation needed now.<a href="https://twitter.com/donaldtusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@donaldtusk</a> <a href="https://t.co/WbjtaEydBs">pic.twitter.com/WbjtaEydBs</a></p>&mdash; Joe Brew (@joethebrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/joethebrew/status/1044628556066762752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">25 de setembre de 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Though the prevalence of "fake news" has certainly increased with the internet, the facts remain:

- Police used excessive violence on October 1st 2017.
- Hundreds of Catalan citizens were injured.
- Thousands of images and videos of that violence are real and have been verified.

# Manipulation 2: International democracy watchdogs approve of Spain's handling of Catalonia

Several slides show Spain's high rankings in freedom/democracy indices. These are true: Spain is considered by "Freedom House" as a "free" country, and the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Spain as a "Full democracy" with scores similar to other Western European countries:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/3.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/2.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

But including the scores without any other information from these reports is **intentionally misleading.**

### Freedom House

For example, in [Freedom House's report on Spain](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/spain), the Spanish government is described as having "used aggressive methods to disrupt the referendum". The report also points out that "the national public broadcaster RTVE was criticized by its own journalists...for biased coverage of the Catalonia crisis". In the "Freedom of assembly" section, Spain is given a score of 3/4, noting that "police actions during referendum-related demonstrations in Catalonia prompted allegations of excessive force against protesters".

### Economist Intelligence Unit

[The Economist Intelligence Unit's 2017 report](https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf) on outlining their "Democracy Index" included the headline "Spain's democratic credentials suffer" as the third of its ten "highlights" of 2017. The report points out that Spain is "just above the threshold for full democracies" and that "the national government’s attempt to stop by force Catalonia’s illegal
referendum on independence on October 1st and its repressive treatment of pro-independence politicians have put it at risk of becoming a 'flawed democracy'". Spain suffered the second largest decline in the democracy index score (first place was Malta).

# Manipulation 3: The independence movement is like Le Pen / Front National

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/4.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/5.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The "Front National" movement in France is:
- Anti-immigrant
- Right-wing
- Anti-democratic.

The Catalan independence movement is, quantifiably, none of these three things.


### Anti-immigrant

Data on attitudes toward immigration in Catalonia suggest that those in favor of independence are far less hostile to immigration than those in favor of union:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/d.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/d.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Right-wing

The attempt to associate the Catalan independence movement with right-wing movements in other parts of Europe is intentionally misleading. This tactic seeks to characterize Catalan independence as the ideological equivalent of right-wing reactionary movements. The data show the opposite: the independence movement is ideologically _to the left_ of the Spanish unionist movement, and is consistently more left-leaning than Spanish unionism in survey after survey:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/b.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/b.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

As of the most recent data available (July 2018), support for independence was highest on the left. Support for union was highest on the right:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/bb.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/bb.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Relative to the rest of Spain, Catalans are consistently more left-leaning:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/z.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/z.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Self-situated ideology on a left-right scale (as in the above charts) is potentially biased. But the "Catalan independence movement is right-wing" accusation also falls apart if you examine individual political policies. For example, relative to Catalan unionists, those in favor of independence are also more in favor of the government taking measures to reduce income inequality.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/a.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/a.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the same vein, if one examines negative attitudes toward homosexuality (a relatively good proxy for being "right-wing"), it is clear that those who are favorable to independence do not fit the "right-wing" category.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/f.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/f.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>


Finally, we can examine levels of support of different politicians from people of different ideological backgrounds. The most well-known independence leader in Catalonia is Carles Puigdemont; the most well-known union leader in Catalonia is Ines Arrmiadas. Puigdemont receives high levels of support from the left, and low levels from the right; Arrimadas receives low levels of support from the left, and high levels from the right. The group in Catalonia which gives the highest levels of support to Arrimadas is the far-right.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/c.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/c.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Anti-democratic

The characterization of the Catalan independence movement as "anti-democratic" is strange. Among Catalans in favor of independence, 91% say that democracy is preferable to all other forms of government in all circumstances; this figure is only 77% among Catalans in favor of union with Spain.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/e.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/e.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>



# Manipulation 4: Independence movement is like Brexit

The presentation implies that the Catalan independence movement is a nationalist movement of the same nature as the British nationalist movement which drove Brexit to victory:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/6.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/7.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Support for Brexit was positively correlated with age: the older one was, the more likely he/she voted in favor of Brexit. In Catalonia, support for independence takes on the opposite pattern:


<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/h.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/h.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Support for Brexit was negatively correlated with education: the more educated one was, the less likely he/she voted in favor of education. Again, in Catalonia, support for independence takes on the opposite pattern as support for Brexit:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/i.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/i.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Finally, support for Brexit was primarily driven by anti-immigrant attitudes (and as mentioned in the previous section, those in favor of independence are more favorable to immigration than those opposed to independence).

# Manipulation 5: Independence is undesirable because it's a movement of the rich

The presentation contains a chart from El Pais which shows that more wealth is correlated with more support for Catalan independence.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/8.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is true: support for independence is associated with higher income levels. But as dissuasive rhetoric, it is relatively ineffective. Higher incomes associates with (a) higher access to information, (b) higher levels of education, (c) more engagement with what is going on in politics.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/j.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/j.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The wealthy support Catalan independence more than the poor. But the wealthy also opposed Brexit more than the poor and opposed Trump more than the poor. Those with higher income consistently vote for more open immigration policies and are less euro-skeptic.

# Manipulation 6: More people oppose independence than support it

The presentation shows results from the December 21, 2017 elections in Catalonia to suggest that independence is a minority movement:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/9.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/xxx.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/xxx.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>



# Manipulation 7: The cities don't support independence



<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/10.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/11.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/xxx.png"> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/powerpoint/xxx.png" /></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
