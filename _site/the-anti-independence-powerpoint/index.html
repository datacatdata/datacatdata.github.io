      <p><a href="https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2018-10-07/el-dosier-anti-independencia-que-circula-por-la-ue-y-borrell-ya-ha-enviado-a-las-embajadas_1626530/">El Confidencial reports</a> that Josep Borrell (Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs) has forwarded to diplomatic posts a powerpoint presentation critical of the Catalan independence movement. <a href="http://localhost:4000/pdfs/buenoarmijo.pdf">The document</a>, a 27 page powerpoint, compares the independence movement with Marine Le Pen’s Front National and Brexit, points out Spain’s high rankings in democratic indices, suggests that police violence against Catalan voters on October 1 2017 was fake news, and paints the independence movement as a political force driven by the rural and the wealthy.</p>

<p>Though we do not know the full context under which the document’s author, Antonio Bueno-Armijo, presented the powerpoint to the European External Action Service, the presentation’s structure and content imply several factually incorrect and misleading arguments about the Catalan independence movement. In this article, we’ll dive into five implicit lies in the anti-independence dossier.</p>

<h1 id="manipulation-1-police-violence-against-voters-on-october-1-was-fake-news">Manipulation 1: Police violence against voters on October 1 was “fake news”</h1>

<table style="border: 0.1px solid black">
<tr>
<td>
<font size="5">Some images were fake. Most are real.</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Several slides of the presentation show images of police violence overlapped by a scroll-with-wings icon to suggest that the images were false:</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/powerpoint/0.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/powerpoint/1.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The implicit argument is that since <em>some</em> of the images showing police violence on October 1, 2017 were false, one cannot trust that police violence occurred at all. This tactic is a familiar one. It seeks to minimize the perception of the level of police violence during the Catalan referendum by changing the topic of the conversation from real violence to fake images. It was employed last October by then Foreign Minister Alfono Dastis:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ca"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spanish Foreign Minister <a href="https://twitter.com/AlfonsoDastisQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AlfonsoDastisQ</a> says pictures of Spanish police beating Catalans is &#39;fake news&#39; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/marr?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#marr</a> <a href="https://t.co/tpJ5ZtVX9z">pic.twitter.com/tpJ5ZtVX9z</a></p>&mdash; The Andrew Marr Show (@MarrShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarrShow/status/922019217234259970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">22 d’octubre de 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The “fake news” angle has more recently employed by Spanish government spokesperson Isabel Celaá, who suggested that <a href="https://youtu.be/Uotxawat8pE">“many of the images”</a> from the October 1 referendum were fake, and that the police acted in “proportionality” with the exception of very few cases.</p>

<p>It is true that some images showing police violence and victims in October 2017 were false, manipulated, or simply from other events. These images were widely shared in some cases, but also quickly discredited.</p>

<p>True occurrences of police violence have been <a href="https://catmemoria.cat/en/">meticulously documented and fact-checked</a>, and reported on by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/01/europe/catalonia-spain-independence-referendum-vote/index.html">international media</a>. Police body-camera footage has been released as well:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ca"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Subtitled in English: Spanish police storming voting sites last Oct in an attempt to prevent Catalonia from voting on its independence.<br /><br />Many of the leaders who arranged the vote are in jail.<br />The police beating people in these videos are not.<br /><br />EU Mediation needed now.<a href="https://twitter.com/donaldtusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@donaldtusk</a> <a href="https://t.co/WbjtaEydBs">pic.twitter.com/WbjtaEydBs</a></p>&mdash; Joe Brew (@joethebrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/joethebrew/status/1044628556066762752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">25 de setembre de 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Though the prevalence of “fake news” has certainly increased with the internet, the facts remain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Police used excessive violence on October 1st 2017.</li>
  <li>Thousands of images and videos of that violence are real and have been verified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trying to convert the scandal about police violence against voters into a scandal about fake news is simply <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/14/the-death-of-truth-how-we-gave-up-on-facts-and-ended-up-with-trump">Trumpian</a>.</p>

<h1 id="manipulation-2-international-democracy-watchdogs-approve-of-spains-handling-of-catalonia">Manipulation 2: International democracy watchdogs approve of Spain’s handling of Catalonia</h1>

<p>Several slides show Spain’s high rankings in freedom/democracy indices. These are true: Spain is considered by “Freedom House” as a “free” country, and the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Spain as a “Full democracy” with scores similar to other Western European countries:</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/powerpoint/3.png" /></td>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/powerpoint/2.png" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>But including the scores without any other information from these reports is <strong>intentionally misleading.</strong></p>

<h3 id="freedom-house">Freedom House</h3>

<p>For example, in <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/spain">Freedom House’s report on Spain</a>, the Spanish government is described as having “used aggressive methods to disrupt the referendum”. The report also points out that “the national public broadcaster RTVE was criticized by its own journalists…for biased coverage of the Catalonia crisis”. In the “Freedom of assembly” section, Spain is given a score of 3/4, noting that Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sànchez “police actions during referendum-related demonstrations in Catalonia prompted allegations of excessive force against protesters”.</p>

<h3 id="economist-intelligence-unit">Economist Intelligence Unit</h3>

<p><a href="https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf">The Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2017 report</a> on outlining their “Democracy Index” included the headline “Spain’s democratic credentials suffer” as the third of its ten “highlights” of 2017. The report points out that Spain is “just above the threshold for full democracies” and that “the national government’s attempt to stop by force Catalonia’s illegal
referendum on independence on October 1st and its repressive treatment of pro-independence politicians have put it at risk of becoming a ‘flawed democracy’”. Spain suffered the second largest decline in the democracy index score (first place was Malta).</p>
